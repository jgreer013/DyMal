Understanding a software's behavior, both intrinsically and in relation to other software, is an important stepping stone towards effective program behavioral analysis and can give greater insights into understanding how programs relate to one another. We detail the importance of this understanding and of having interpretable behavioral components and presented our system LIBCAISE, a novel approach to identifying behavioral components in software by applying NLP techniques to the domain of software analysis. While there are various tradeoffs to our approach, it succinctly captures multi-level interpretable software behavior and lays important groundwork on which a variety of directions may extend from.
