Determining the number of topics is a difficult problem for LDA as it may change depending on the number of documents and their contents. One could perform a hyperparameter grid search, using perplexity as the basis for determining the optimal number of topics; however, perplexity may not be an adequate measure. Change \textit{et al.} \cite{chang2009reading} found that perplexity didn't correlate with human judgment in the topics found very well. While there may be other methods for determining the adequacy of a number of topics, it may be more beneficial to use the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process \cite{teh2005sharing}, as it generates similar results compared to LDA, but the number of topics is no longer a hyperparameter and is instead determined by the model. Applying HDP instead of LDA may be more beneficial for determining the number of topics; however, there are still other hyperparameters which need to be tuned, and HDP may not be as performant as LDA.
