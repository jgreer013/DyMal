In its current state, our system largely focuses on behavior as separate from context, but combining this with a contextual analysis system would greatly enhance understanding of behavior. For one, incorporating the arguments of the instructions would give greater clarity in terms of the actual operations and machine state being altered by the program itself. Beyond the instructions themselves, incorporating the environment and machine state into the model (such as the physical environment around the machine, the type of machine, or the machine's operating system) would assist in generating a system-wide view of behavior and how its state is modified by the underlying behavioral components. This would improve understanding of software and its behavior and would be particularly beneficial for isolating malware and determining its severity in a given context.
