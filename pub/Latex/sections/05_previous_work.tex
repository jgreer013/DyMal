Much work has been done on understanding and analyzing general program behavior and how malware's behavior is differentiated from it, though as will be shown, few works have tried to maintain interpretability throughout the entirety of the model pipeline, thus outlining one of the main benefits to this project's approach, particularly for human experts. There are other approaches to interpretable machine learning discussed below as well.
