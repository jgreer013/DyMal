As it currently stands, there are a multitude of libraries built for large-scale LDA, such as Microsoft's LightLDA; however, the results we gained from using hLDA seemed more closely aligned with what we'd prefer as a way to understand programs in relation to one another while still understanding their underlying behavioral components. It would be interesting to repeat the analysis for the large-scale data set using hLDA if a more efficient and scalable version could be created, as hierarchical components are a more appropriate conceptualization of program behavior than flat components, as programs are typically created in a hierarchical and object-oriented framework.
