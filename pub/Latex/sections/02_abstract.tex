\begin{abstract}
Traditional approaches to understanding program behavior involve either classifying programs with supervised machine learning algorithms or manually reverse engineering software. While many powerful classifiers exist, the features used by the classifiers often lack interpretability in the context of the software's behavior. As software and malware production increases, creating human-readable understanding of program behavior becomes more imperative. We propose LIBCAISE, a novel approach to understanding software behavior by applying clustering and topic modeling algorithms to assemblies of binary files to learn interpretable behavioral components of programs from assembly instructions of software executables. We apply this approach to statically derived assembly codes of multiple binary files and discuss the results of this as well as potential ways to expand upon the work.
