After converting the assembly commands to their corresponding cluster ID's, a way to have components with interpretable behavior was desired. Individual commands carry little meaning beyond their intended purpose, as one cannot extrapolate the meaning of a single "mov" or "pop" statement beyond its intended purpose; however, one can derive greater understanding of behavior through sequences of terms rather than singular terms. This brings us to N-Grams, which are sequences of terms (in this case cluster IDs) adjacent to each other (e.g. the 2-grams of "mov addl mov pop" are "mov addl", "addl mov", and "mov pop"). Smaller N-grams are less interpretable than large N-grams, and so a sizeable N must be chosen to maintain interpretability, which for our purposes means N = 8. Unfortunately, this has the side effect of drastically increasing vocabulary, so some caution must be taken.
