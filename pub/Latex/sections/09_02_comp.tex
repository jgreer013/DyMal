The results of LDA are a per-document distribution on the topics, as well as a per-topic distribution on the terms. Hypothetically, one could discretize these distributions and apply LDA again, creating another latent topic set by which one could describe the previous topics. The application of this to language is clear, as the initial topics are then mixed to create more abstract versions. For the purposes of understanding programs, this could be thought of as combining behavioral components into more abstract, yet still interpretable, higher-level components. This would be a interesting direction to focus in, as it could be used to describe higher-order functions that human experts unfamiliar to assembly instructions could still understand.
